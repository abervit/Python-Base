#### If we want to calculate the area of rectangle we need to know two sides of it - length and width
print("Area = width*length")

width = float(input("Enter your width: "))
length = float(input("Enter your length: "))
### we can use float or int functions. depends on our numbers - whole or decimals
area = width*length
print(area)
print("The area of rectangle is ", area)
